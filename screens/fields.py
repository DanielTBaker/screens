        Effective distance.  Should be constant; if different for

    mu_eff : ~astropy.units.Quantity
        Effective proper motion (``v_eff / d_eff``), parallel to ``theta_par``.
    t : ~astropy.units.Quantity
        Times for which the dynamic wave spectrum should be calculated.
        Should broadcast with ``f`` to give the dynamic spectrum shape.
    f : ~astropy.units.frequency
        Frequencies for which the spectrum should be calculated.
